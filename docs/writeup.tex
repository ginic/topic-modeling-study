\section{Motivation}
Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) is a widely adopted approach for unsupervised topic modeling and has been used across disciplines for exploring themes and trends in collections of documents. LDA has been applied to explore the ever-growing collections of text from online platforms and social media and analyze language changes in academic fields over time \cite{koltsova2013, mcfarland2013differentiating,vogel-jurafsky-2012-said,mitrofanova2015probabilistic}.
